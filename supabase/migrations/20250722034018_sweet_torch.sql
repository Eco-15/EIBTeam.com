  # Fix Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

  1. Problem
    - RLS policies on user_roles table are creating infinite recursion
    - Policies that check user roles are querying the same table they protect
    - This creates circular dependencies causing 500 errors

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing RLS policies that cause recursion
    - Create simple policies that don't reference user_roles table
    - Use direct auth.uid() checks instead of role-based checks
    - Temporarily disable RLS on problematic tables to allow access

  3. Security
    - Maintain user isolation through auth.uid() checks
    - Admin access controlled at application level
    - Remove circular policy dependencies
